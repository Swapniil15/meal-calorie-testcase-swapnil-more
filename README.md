## üß™ API Test Cases (Playwright)

This project uses **Playwright** for automated API testing of backend routes like authentication, calorie lookup, and feedback submission.

---

### üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the backend server running at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

And install Playwright if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

Create a .env file in the root directory:


```bash

BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
PASSWORD=secure123

```
---

### üßæ Sample Test File

The test cases are written in `tests/api.spec.js`:

```bash
tests/api.spec.js
```

> Covers registration, login, calorie API, feedback, and auth-protected routes.

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Tests

Run all tests using:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run with UI (headed mode):

```bash
npx playwright test tests/api.spec.js --headed
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Config Notes

* Modify `baseURL` if your server uses a different port.
* Ensure test data like emails are dynamic using `Date.now()` to avoid collisions.
* All endpoints requiring `Authorization` use Bearer token headers.
